# Challenge 1: HTML, CSS, and Git

## Description

My motivation was to gain a better understanding of HTML, CSS, and Git through refactoring the code for Horiseon's webpage. I built this project to sharpen my front-end web development skills and learn how to use and structure both semantic HTML elements and CSS selectors. My project solves Horiseon's accessibilty issues by adding alt attributes and refactoring the webpage's code to make it more concise with a logical flow.
